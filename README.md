# Speedtest
Run internet speed tests on my home network.

Having recently moved into a new location, my current setup includes separate modem and router. 
The router is a bit outdated so I'm testing speeds throughout the house using this little Python script that calls [ookla's speedtest executable](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/desktop) to run speed tests.
