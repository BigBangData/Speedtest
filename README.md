# Speedtest

Having recently moved into a new location, my current setup includes a separate router. 
The Belkin router is a bit outdated so I'm testing average speeds throughout the house using this little Python script that calls [ookla's speedtest executable](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/desktop) to run speed tests. 

UPDATES

- 23rd test: moved the router, added a 'router location' key to the data files 
- 28th test: started gathering jitter and latency
