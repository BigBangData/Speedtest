# Speedtest

Having recently moved into a new location, my current setup includes a separate router. 
The router is a bit outdated so I'm testing average speeds throughout the house using this little Python script that calls [ookla's speedtest executable](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/desktop) to run speed tests.
